# Zootopia - Zoo Database Management System

Zootopia is a zoo database management system.  The project is composed of a sample database and a graphic user interface that allows the zoo manager and the employees to carry out maintenance and management of the zoo database.

The three groups of users for this application are the zoo managers, the animal keepers and the animal trainers.  Each group of the users has its own class (ZooMananger, Keeper, and Trainer) and each class contains methods specific to for members of each group to carry out their tasks. Moreover, each class has a JDBC Driver so they can interact with the oracle database (which we implement in the Driver class).
